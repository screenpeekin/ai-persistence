## Current Status

**AI Persistence System - Operational**

Complete initialization successful. Directory structure established with agent-files/ containing ai/, reports/, and templates/ subdirectories. All summary files created and templated. Workflow defined as semi-automated with propose-then-approve pattern. System is production-ready for documentation sessions.

**Key capabilities:**
- Session tracking with Activity, Decision, and Reference logs
- Blockers → Allowers flow for problem tracking
- Cross-AI continuity (ready for Gemini integration)
- Report generation with code snippets and configurations
- Template-driven consistency

## Active Work

**Current Session:** None (last session ended 2025-11-05)

**Next Session Goals:**
- Test system with real work documentation
- Evaluate report format with actual content
- Consider cross-AI testing with Gemini

- **Initialized AI persistence system** - Created complete directory structure and all required files
- **Established workflow** - Semi-automated propose-then-approve pattern with workflow instructions
- **Created documentation** - CLAUDE.md, QUICK-REFERENCE.md, SESSION-DEMO.md guides
- **Simplified tracking** - Removed Error Logs, established Blockers → Allowers flow
- **Made key decisions** - 5 architectural decisions documented with full context and rationale
- **Generated first report** - 2025-11-05-report.md with highlights, configurations, commands, code snippets

## Key Decisions

### 1. Blockers → Allowers Flow
Consolidated Error Logs into simpler flow where resolved blockers become allowers with solutions documented.

### 2. Semi-Automated Documentation
AI monitors and proposes content, user approves before writing. Balances efficiency with accuracy.

### 3. Always Merge Summaries
Summary Agent merges both AI files even if only one AI active, keeping unified summary current.

### 4. Include Code and Configs
Reports include code snippets and configuration file contents for self-contained reproducibility.

### 5. Workflow Instructions
Use natural language workflow instructions instead of rigid slash commands for flexibility.

## Allowers

### User Question-Driven Design
Asked clarifying questions before implementation to understand preferences. Four questions revealed all key decisions.

### Subdirectory Organization
Clean separation: ai/ for AI-managed files, reports/ for documentation, templates/ for format references.

### Template-Driven Consistency
Created template files ensuring consistent formatting across all generated documents.

## Open Questions
