- Created all summary files: summary-c.md, summary-g.md, and unified summary.md
- Established three reusable templates (report, session, summary)
- Refined starter.md based on user preferences through clarifying questions
- Created STARTER.md frozen reference in project root
- Generated QUICK-REFERENCE.md for at-a-glance workflow guide
- Generated SESSION-DEMO.md showing complete session walkthrough with examples

## Configurations

### Directory Structure
Established agent-files organization:
```
agent-files/
├── starter.md              # User-editable project definition
├── ai/                     # AI-managed files
│   ├── claude.md           # Claude-specific context
│   ├── gemini.md           # Gemini-specific context
│   ├── summary-c.md        # Claude's working memory
│   ├── summary-g.md        # Gemini's working memory
│   └── summary.md          # Unified summary (read at session start)
├── reports/                # Generated session reports
│   └── 2025-11-05-report.md
└── templates/              # Reference templates
    ├── report-template.md
    ├── session-template.md
    └── summary-template.md
```

### CLAUDE.md Content
Created comprehensive guidance file including:
- Project overview and architecture
- File structure with lowercase naming convention
- Session workflow (start, during, end)
- Log categories (Activity, Decision, Reference)
- Blockers vs Allowers distinction
- Four agent types (Summary, Context, Index, Report)
- Design principles
- Cross-AI continuity notes

### Initial Summary Files
Created empty summary files with section structure:
```markdown
# [AI Name] Session Summary
Last updated: Never
Session count: 0

## Current Status
## Activity Logs
## Decision Logs
## Reference Logs
## Blockers
## Allowers
```

### Template Files
Created three templates with consistent markdown structure:
- `summary-template.md` - For AI summary updates
- `report-template.md` - For session documentation
- `session-template.md` - For session tracking

## Commands Used

```bash
# Created directory structure
mkdir -p agent-files/ai agent-files/reports agent-files/templates
```

```bash
# Organized existing files into new structure
mv starter.md agent-files/
mv CLAUDE.md agent-files/ai/claude.md
mv GEMINI.md agent-files/ai/gemini.md
```

```bash
# Created frozen reference copy in project root
cp agent-files/starter.md STARTER.md
```

```bash
# Verified structure
find agent-files -type f | sort
ls -la *.md
```

### User Question-Driven Design
- **Solution**: Asked clarifying questions to understand workflow preferences before implementing
- **Context**: Needed to determine automation level, merge behavior, report format
- **Usage**: Four key questions revealed: workflow instructions (not slash commands), semi-automated tracking, always merge summaries, include code/config in reports

### Subdirectory Organization
- **Solution**: Created subdirectories (ai/, reports/, templates/) within agent-files/
- **Context**: Needed clean separation between AI-managed files, generated reports, and reference templates
- **Usage**: Keeps related files together, easy to navigate, clear purpose for each directory

### Template-Driven Consistency
- **Solution**: Created three template files as formatting references
- **Context**: Ensures consistent structure across reports and summaries
- **Usage**: Reference templates/ when generating new reports or updating summaries

### Blockers → Allowers Flow
- **Solution**: Simplified from separate Error Logs to single flow where resolved Blockers become Allowers
- **Context**: Eliminated redundancy between Error Logs and Allowers
- **Usage**: When blocker is resolved, document the solution as an Allower with full context

### Semi-Automated Proposal Pattern
- **Solution**: AI proposes documentation content, user approves before writing
- **Context**: Balance between automation efficiency and user control
- **Usage**: AI monitors and proposes, user provides approval or feedback for adjustments
