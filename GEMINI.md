# AI Persistence & Context System

A documentation, note taker and report generator that that leverages AI assistants remember context across sessions and platforms

## Core Concept

Generate a report with the most critical commands and steps ran for documentation purposes. This system enables seamless collaboration between Claude, Gemini, and other AI clients by maintaining persistent context across sessions. Each AI maintains its own working memory while contributing to a unified project understanding.

The system generates summary reports documenting workflows, configurations, decisions, and blockers - allowing you to pick up exactly where you left off, regardless of which AI client you're using.

### Initialization Process

1. User creates and edits `starter.md` to define their project
2. User runs `/init` with their AI client (Claude Code or Gemini CLI)
3. AI reads `starter.md` and executes the following steps:

**Step 1: Create Directory Structure**
```bash
mkdir -p agent-files/ai agent-files/templates reports
```

**Step 2: Create Frozen Reference**
```bash
cp agent-files/starter.md STARTER.md
```

**Step 3: Create AI Summary Files**
Create `agent-files/ai/summary-c.md`, `summary-g.md`, and `summary.md` with initial empty structure (see Template Formats below).

**Step 4: Create AI Context Files**
Create `agent-files/ai/claude.md` and `agent-files/ai/gemini.md` with full specifications (see CLAUDE.md Specification and GEMINI.md Specification sections below).

**Step 5: Create Templates**
Create `agent-files/templates/summary-template.md`, `report-template.md`, and `session-template.md` (see Template Formats below).

**Step 6: Create Guide Files (Optional)**
Create `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` and `SESSION-DEMO.md` in project root for user reference.

4. User no longer edits `starter.md` after initialization

## Primary Goals

Ordered by implementation sequence:

1. **Session continuity** - Pick up where you left off across different sessions and AI clients
2. **Create summaries** - Generate session reports documenting commands, decisions, blockers, and allowers for easy reference
3. **Project reproducibility** - Create guides to recreate projects and configurations
4. **Automated documentation** - AI creates showcase content from project work

## File Structure

Single-project structure with AI-managed files organized in subfolders:

```
/
├── STARTER.md              # Frozen reference (created by /init)
├── reports/                # Generated session reports (project root)
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD-report.md
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-report.md
└── agent-files/
    ├── starter.md          # User-editable (only before /init)
    ├── ai/                 # AI-managed files (manually committed to git)
    │   ├── summary-c.md    # Claude's session summaries
    │   ├── summary-g.md    # Gemini's session summaries
    │   ├── summary.md      # Unified summary (read at session start)
    │   ├── claude.md       # Claude-specific context
    │   └── gemini.md       # Gemini-specific context
    └── templates/          # Blank templates (populated as needed)
        ├── summary-template.md
        ├── project-template.md
        └── session-template.md
```

### File Relationships

- `claude.md` ↔ `gemini.md` - Synced project instructions
- `summary-c.md` - Claude's working memory (updated at session end)
- `summary-g.md` - Gemini's working memory (updated at session end)
- `summary.md` - Unified context (read at session start, updated at session end)
- `reports/` - Session reports with highlights, configurations, and commands used

## Session Lifecycle

### Starting a Session

**Workflow instruction:** When starting, user tells AI to begin session.

The AI will:
1. **Pull from git** - Run `git pull` to get latest changes from remote
2. **Check for external changes** - If git pull brought updates:
   - Review what changed using `git log` and `git diff`
   - Add external changes to summary context
   - Announce what was updated externally (e.g., "Gemini made changes to X")
3. Read `ai/summary.md` to load context from previous sessions
4. Announce what it found:
   - Current status of the project
   - Open blockers that need attention
   - Recent changes from last session (including external changes)
   - Suggested next steps
5. Begin monitoring all activity for the session report

### During a Session

**Semi-automated tracking:** The AI continuously monitors and proposes what to document:
- Commands executed
- Files modified
- Decisions made
- Configurations changed
- Problems encountered and solved
- Resources referenced

The AI will propose documentation items for user approval before finalizing.

### Ending a Session

**Workflow instruction:** When ending, user tells AI to complete session documentation.

The AI will:
1. **Ask user for report format preference:**
   - **Every command**: All commands in sequence (copy-paste script style)
   - **Key actions**: Important steps with context (skip trivial file operations)
   - **Recipe style**: Prerequisites + high-level steps + key commands only

2. **Generate how-to report** in `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-report.md` with format:
   - **Title**: How to [Task Name] - YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Objective**: What this guide teaches
   - **Overview**: Brief summary of what was accomplished
   - **How to Replicate**: Step-by-step instructions (detail level based on user choice)
     - Prerequisites (tools, configs, starting state)
     - Steps with commands and context
     - Key configurations or code created
   - **Blockers**: New issues that need resolution
   - **Allowers**: Solutions that successfully unblocked work
   - **Results**: What you'll have after following the guide

3. Update `ai/summary-c.md` (Claude) or `ai/summary-g.md` (Gemini) with session details

4. **Always merge** both AI summaries into unified `ai/summary.md` for next session start (even if only one AI was active this session)

5. **Commit and push to git** - Backup session work to remote:
   - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
   - Commit with descriptive message including what was accomplished
   - Push to remote with `git push origin master`

### Merge Summaries (Manual Sync)

**You say:** "Merge summaries" or "Sync summaries" or "Update summary.md"

**AI will follow:** `agent-files/templates/summary-merge-template.md`

**Purpose:** Manually sync summaries without creating report or pushing to git.

**Use cases:**
- Mid-session sync between Claude and Gemini
- After external changes detected
- Before switching AI clients
- Quick sync without full session end

**Default workflow:**
1. Read both `summary-c.md` and `summary-g.md`
2. Merge into unified `summary.md` (current status, logs, blockers, allowers)
3. Display confirmation with counts
4. **Does NOT** create report, commit, or push

**Customize:** Edit `agent-files/templates/summary-merge-template.md` to change merge logic.

### Cross-AI Continuity

When switching between Claude and Gemini:
1. Previous AI has already updated its summary file (`summary-c.md` or `summary-g.md`)
2. Summary Agent **always merges both** into `summary.md` (even if one AI had no activity)
3. New AI reads `summary.md` at session start and picks up where you left off
4. Both AIs contribute to the same project understanding

**Note:** If only one AI has been active, the merge still occurs. The inactive AI's summary file remains unchanged while the active AI's updates are merged into the unified summary.

## Summary File Contents

Each summary file tracks:

### Session Information
- Activity timestamps
- Commands executed
- Files modified
- Cross-references between related projects

### Blockers
Issues preventing progress that need resolution across sessions. Or a configuration that doesn't work with installed dependencies

### Allowers
Configurations, commands, or code that made something work successfully. These are reference points for reproducing solutions.

### Annotations
Reminders about previous solutions or configurations when recreating similar setups

### Daily Highlights
Key accomplishments and discoveries from each session

---

## Log Categories

Summaries organize information into four log types:

### 1. Activity Logs
- Commands run
- Files changed
- Actions taken during session

### 2. Decision Logs
- Architectural choices made
- Rationale for "why we did X not Y"
- Trade-offs considered

### 3. Reference Logs
- Links consulted
- Documentation referenced
- Tutorials followed
- External resources used

### 4. (Removed - consolidated into Blockers/Allowers)
When an issue is resolved, it transitions from **Blocker** to **Allower** with the solution documented.

## Agent System

The system uses specialized sub-agents to manage files and maintain context:

### Summary Agent
- Merges `summary-c.md` and `summary-g.md` into unified `summary.md`
- Extracts common patterns and reconciles conflicts

### Context Agent
- Monitors blockers and allowers
- Flags unresolved issues across sessions
- Surfaces relevant annotations when similar work is detected

### Index Agent
- Maintains `index.md` with project status
- Tracks cross-project relationships
- Updates last_modified timestamps

### Report Agent
- Generates report from other agent files, in a clean markdown format that uses AI to determine what I ran

Agents analyze chat history to automatically populate summaries, reducing manual documentation burden.

## Design Principles

- Creates readable, simple, and clean documentation of work accomplished.
- **AI-agnostic format** - Use markdown with clear section headers for universal parsing
- **Lowercase convention** - All managed files use lowercase names for consistency
- **Single project focus** - One `agent-files/` directory per project repository
- **Session-based workflow** - Explicit `/start-session` and `/end-session` commands for clear boundaries
- **Retrieval-focused** - Optimize for quickly finding "where did I leave off?"
- **Git integration** - Will leverage git commits for tracking changes (to be implemented)
