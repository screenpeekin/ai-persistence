## Current Status
Initial setup phase for AI persistence system. STARTER.md template created and protected with read-only rules in both CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md.

## Recent Changes
- Created STARTER.md from project-concept.md as the master project guide
- Added Protected Files section to CLAUDE.md (line 105-114)
- Synced protection rules to GEMINI.md (line 65-74)
- STARTER.md is now read-only after initial template creation phase
- User updated STARTER.md title to "AI-Powered Portfolio & Task Showcase"

## Open Questions & Blockers
- [ ] Line 5 in STARTER.md incomplete: "BUILDING AND I WANT TO WALK THROUGH EACH STEP BY YOU ASKING ME QUESTIONS" - needs clarification on what exactly is being built
- [ ] Which sections of STARTER.md need expansion or refinement?
- [ ] What should be the first implementation priority?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Return to @STARTER.md to continue template development
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions about project scope and priorities
- [ ] Refine incomplete sections through Q&A walkthrough
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 implementation once STARTER.md template is finalized

## Decision Log
- **File Protection Rule**: STARTER.md designated as read-only master guide after initial creation phase. Any future methodology changes require user discussion.
- **Cross-AI Sync**: Protection rules added to both CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md to ensure consistency across AI clients.
