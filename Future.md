It will be more designed for finding the solution to a problem. So its framework and its summary file (summary-g.md) need to reflect that style. And tailor the agent to be more specific to these tasks. 
- Turn off the feature to push and pull from github when starting and ending a session, and instead create a prompt that asks the user what they want to do (give the first option as no, so if I spam hit enter it doesn't make an unwarranted change).
